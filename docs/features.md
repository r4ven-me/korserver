# Feature requirements

## ocserv server

Implement config generation for common ocserv options:

- TCP port;
- UDP support;
- server certificate and key;
- CA certificate;
- auth methods;
- network and netmask;
- DNS servers;
- split DNS/search domains where appropriate;
- routes and no-routes;
- max clients;
- max same clients;
- keepalive;
- compression;
- Cisco AnyConnect compatibility;
- camouflage / secret URL;
- realm;
- isolation/chroot options where applicable;
- connect/disconnect hooks.

Do not attempt to expose every obscure ocserv option in GUI v1. Support an `advanced.raw_ocserv_options` map/list for unsupported options with validation and warnings.

## Users

Required:

- create user;
- delete user;
- disable user;
- enable user;
- change password;
- list users;
- inspect user state;
- export client artifacts.

## Certificates

Required:

- internal CA generation;
- server certificate generation;
- user certificate generation;
- `.p12` export;
- Apple-compatible `.p12` export mode;
- CRL generation;
- certificate revoke;
- CRL reset;
- reload ocserv after CRL update;
- support externally mounted cert/key/CA files.

## OTP/TOTP

Required:

- enable OTP for user;
- disable OTP;
- generate secret;
- show QR in CLI as terminal QR or base64/PNG for GUI;
- never log OTP seed;
- store `users.oath` safely.

## Identity / OIDC

ocserv does not provide a native browser-based OIDC redirect flow for VPN clients.
Korvus Server models OIDC providers and group policies, then connects ocserv to an
external identity bridge through PAM or RADIUS. Use the IdP's PAM/RADIUS integration
or an outpost/proxy that returns ocserv-compatible users and groups.

Required:

- configure OIDC providers such as Keycloak or authentik;
- store provider client secrets through normal secret references;
- render ocserv PAM/RADIUS auth directives;
- render `config-per-group` files;
- map IdP groups to ocserv group policies;
- manage routes, no-routes, DNS, split DNS and client limits per group;
- expose identity and group management in CLI/API/GUI;
- never return `client_secret` from API/GUI reads.

## Sessions

Required:

- list active sessions through occtl;
- parse connected username, VPN IP, real IP, connected time and traffic counters if available;
- disconnect user/session;
- show session details.

## Upstream OpenConnect client

Required:

- enable/disable upstream mode;
- multiple profiles;
- active profile;
- profile switch;
- reconnect loop;
- healthcheck host per profile;
- failover with thresholds;
- logs and status;
- trusted cert option;
- cert/password/p12 auth support;
- secret masking.

## Routing

Required modes:

- direct;
- full;
- split.

Split mode supports:

- static subnets;
- static IPs;
- domains from YAML;
- domains from file;
- dnsmasq integration;
- nftables sets for resolved domain IPs;
- fwmark-based policy routing;
- dedicated route table;
- reload without full container restart where possible.

## GUI pages

- Dashboard.
- Users.
- Certificates.
- OTP.
- Sessions.
- Routing.
- Domains.
- Upstream profiles.
- Config editor with validation and diff.
- Logs.
- Diagnostics.
- Terminal.

## CLI/API/GUI parity

The Web GUI is optional and disabled by default, but when enabled it must be a
management interface, not a read-only dashboard. Domain logic lives in backend
services; CLI and API call those same services, and GUI calls the API.

Runtime-dependent operations must expose their command result and dry-run state in
both CLI and GUI where dry-run is available.

GUI diagnostics should classify expected not-yet-ready runtime state as a warning
instead of a hard failure. Example: an `occtl` socket that is not ready while Korvus
Server is still starting. Project-owned nftables tables/chains/sets are rendered and
applied automatically during Korvus Server startup; `korctl nft apply` remains available
for manual re-apply, dry-run checks and repair after runtime changes. It applies only
Korvus Server firewall/NAT state from the rendered nftables file and does not flush
unrelated host rules.

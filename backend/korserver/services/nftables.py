        Reload, `korctl nft apply`) used to leave a missing rule missing, so

        a separate DROP-policy chain in another table, so under
        `network_mode: host` the VPN client's forwarded traffic (to the

        to docker0 and falls through Docker's own policy regardless of what
        korserver's tables allow -- the kill-switch drop rule still works
        exactly the same way, independently, on top of this.

        `DOCKER-USER` is the chain Docker itself documents as the place for
        this kind of external interoperability rule (evaluated before
        Docker's own rules, and never rewritten by Docker except at chain
        creation). Scoped to the VPN client subnet -- the same address range
        already used for the masquerade rule -- rather than a specific

        device (`kor-client0`, `kor-client1`, ...) that isn't known up
        front, and the same forwarding gap applies to upstream tunnel
        interfaces too.
